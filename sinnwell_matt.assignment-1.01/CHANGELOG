	8/25/22/8:00 pm: I started working on the assignment.  Got an initial grid going and started planning my strategy

	9/5/22/2:00 pm:  Worked for about 5 hours.  I got my seeds generated, added the mountains on the boarder, and planted the trail.

	9/6/22/2:00 pm:  Wrote the code for generating my terrain around the seeds.  Stopped by office hours for help with my Makefile.  I think the only thing I have left to do is to generate the two stores.  After that, if I have time I would like to add more regions if I have time.

	9/7/22/8:00 pm: Added the code for the PokeMart and Pokecenter.  If I have time I would like to add more region seeds but I have a lot of other homework.
