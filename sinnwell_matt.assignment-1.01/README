This is my terrain generation assignment.  I start with initializing the grid to all 0's.  I then create 4 seeds.  Two of the seeds are for the required regions of tall grass, and the other two seeds are for the required regions of clearings.  I then grow those seeds out.  Then I place my boarders around the grid, and  generate some random numbers to place my paths.  Finally I place my Pokemon Center and PokeMart along the paths using another random number generator. Any spots on the map that haven't been filled by my regions, roads, borders, Pokemon Center or PokeMart I fill up with forrest.
