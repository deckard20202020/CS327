I am graduating in May so I have been applying for jobs.  Usually I get sent an
online exam to determine if I will get an interview or not.  All of these
exams are timed Leetcode style problems.  I usually take the exam in Java,
because that's the language I'm most comfortable in.  There is one company
that I would really like to work for that is making me take the exam in C++.
I will be practicing my coding in C++ over christmas break in order to speed
up my C++ coding.  I spoke with the professor and he said I could make this 
my final assignment.  He said that 10 problems should be appropriate.  I
chose a couple of problems listed below.  Each problem on Leetcode.com has 
a ranking of easy, medium, or hard.  I chose 3 easy problems, 4 medium problems,
and 3 hard problems.  The link to each of the problems is below.  I have also
inlcuded a screenshot of the acceptance from leetcode for each problem, as well
as a file that includes the code for each problem.
